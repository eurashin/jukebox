Jukebox is a social music app that doesn't require its users to be social. When you walk into your favorite coffee shop, jukebox can automatically cast a vote for all your favorite types of music. Businesses will use jukebox to create playlists incorporating the tastes of their customers by providing a common access link to authorize access to their Spotify libraries. Jukebox can be trusted to run the music to leave the group satisfied at parties, on road trips, or at any other jam sessions.

Jukebox is a collaborative music app that generates playlists based off the favorite songs and preferences of Spotify users. Users are invited with a link and log in with their Spotify account. The user can choose to connect either their music library or their public playlists, depending on which songs they would like to hear from jukebox.

Juicebox has the potential to provide many playlist and playback features to fit any and every occasion. Filtering libraries by genres, allowing users to select specific songs or personal playlists, and even filtering music by Spotify's analytics as such as "dancability". The most basic settings are to shuffle songs out of the large pool or take turns from each user's libraries.
